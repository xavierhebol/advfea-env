# Using Paraview for visualization

We start by opening [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/). We start by opening the file by pressing `File->Open`. Next you should choose the `Xdmf3ReaderT` to open the data with.

The next step is to visualize each of the functions. To do this, we choose `Filters->Alphabetic->ExtractBlock`. The next step is to select the first Unstructured Grid and press `Apply` as shown below:

We can select the other block to visualize the deflection. There are also options to visualize the deflection in three dimensions using `Filters->Alphabetical->Warp By Scalar`, and change the layout to 3D by pressing the `2D`-button.
